* Fixed wrapper HTML open/close not being rendered for the "Link" field type;

* Added a "View Javascript" field under the "Advanced" tab. This will allow you to input some Javascript to be copied into a auto.js file;
* Added ability to have an URL Link on the "image" field type, next to the existing Page Link;

#v1.0.10

* Replaced jquery.responsiveTabs.min.js with a non minified version - 5.7.4 was causing issues for some strange reason;

#v1.0.9

#v1.0.8

* Field type icon fix for Concrete5 5.7.4.x and higher (based on the release candidate of 5.7.4);

#v1.0.6

* Added ability to enter an email subject for the "email" field type (only when outputted as mailto anchor);
* When caching CSS and Javascript, form validator library could not load the "file" and "date" validator which in turn caused to not validate at all. This is fixed by requiring the file.js with requireAsset;
* Block Configurations can now be loaded by going to "Stacks & Blocks" - "Block Designer" - "Block Config". This page will have the available block types clickable (only when the config.json file exists);
* Block Types within a package that do have a config.json file (and the package is installed), can now also be loaded;

#v1.0.5

* Colorpicker field type now uses Concrete5/core spectrum.css and spectrum.js files (related CSS/JS files deleted);
* Bootstrap Fonts (glyphicons) replaced with Font Awesome (all CSS related files deleted);
* Remaining "renderjs" related files and lines deleted, because this was completely rewritten to "handlebarsjs";
* Caching CSS and JavaScript fix - when this function was turned on (yoursite.com/dashboard/system/optimization/cache), some jQuery functions where not executed, resulting in a non-working page;

* Email field type fix where if no email is being entered, it would give you the notice of an invalid email being entered - so blank values are possible from now on;
* Developers: "getSearchableContent" now needs to return lines of PHP where searchable values can be stored into the "$content" array (like so: $content[] = $this->theFieldSlug);
* Developers: new field type function: "deleteFunctionContents" and "duplicateFunctionContents";
* Developers: "view", "delete" and "duplicate" functions always load the database in a "$db" variable by default (if there were lines returned by field types for these functions);

* Developers: blockType table name passed along to each function of a field type;
* Developers: removed field types' "dbXML" function and replaced this with a "dbFields" function, which will return an array of fields instead of a string of the XML field;

* New field type: youtube;
* Full rewrite from renderjs to Handelebars(js), which is much more powerful - will help A LOT when writing field options for each field type;
* "Text box", "Select" and "URL" field type options/fields now wrapped in div with class "content-field-options";
* Added the ability to enter (a) class name(s) to your "URL" field type links;

* Date_time change to not include CSS/JS on default (as files within js/css directories will automatically get included by Concrete5) by renaming folders;
* Last version number got stuck on 0.9.8, so that may have caused to keep showing the "update addon" button, sorry;
* No more digits allowed in block handle, because namespaces can not (always) use them;
* Removed extra functions (translateFromEditMode) from WYSIWYG field type and rewrote those functions to use the core functions of the "LinkAbstractor" class;
* Prefixed the id attribute of the WYSIWYG field type with "wysiwyg-ft-" in order to maintain all editor functions - thank you "j3ns" for mentioning this;
* Renamed "Cache" tab name to "Advanced", because this tab will have more fields as of now;
* Added an optional "Table prefix" field in the (recently renamed) "Advanced" tab, which will create a table like this "bt<prefix><handle>" (only if the field is filled of course);

#v0.9.9

* New field type: code;
* Removed indenting/spaces before/after prefix/suffix of fields, in order to have everything appended after eachother (needed in some cases);
* Updated link field type validation - thank you "yulolimum" for mentioning possible flaws;
* Sanitize (htmlspecialchars()) output for text_box, text_area and email field types to reduce the risks of XSS (cross site scripting);

* Ability to make a thumbnail of your image field type, by entering the wanted width and height;

* Upon adding a new field when creating a new block, first visible "input", "textarea" or "select" (dropdown) will get focused;
* Animation added for adding fields when creating a block, so they don't magically appear in the list;
* Animation added for deleting fields when creating a block, so they don't magically disappear from the list;
* Better error handling and notification upon installing block types using the build in "Direct install" functionality;
* Fixed a bug when a non-existing field type was being posted (should not happen though, when not manipulating HTML or deleting field types);
* Fixed forgotten t() function for error messages "One or multiple fields are required to build a block." and "-- None --";

#v0.9.6

* Fixed a bug where ft_count for each field type would always reset to 0 over and over (causing code to double include, for example the WYSIWYG field);
* New field type: number;
* JavaScript optimization;
* Minified all packaged CSS to speed up loading and standalone bootstrap fonts and responsive tabs CSS file to be re-used with other pages/field types;
* When changing the field order (sorting fields), the placeholder has the height of the currently dragging item instead of a fixed height which caused the page to change in height;
* Fix when dragging/sorting the first field, it would get a margin at the top as well;
* Fixed bug where all divs with "alert" classes would get instantly hidden within the div .block-designer-container;
* Colored options block for fields that have too many options (number);
* More space/margin added between fields in the block designer configuration page;

* Developers: Rewrote old if(): endif: statements to {} in each field type's "viewContents" function;

#v0.9.5

* Each field type has it's own icon.png file, which will show up in the "Add a field" section. This makes it easier to see what to click, instead of text links;
* After submitting the form with (processed) errors, the form gets fully populated with the given values and fields;
* After having created a block with the block designer, go to `index.php/dashboard/blocks/block_designer/config/[YOUR_BLOCK_HANDLE_HERE]` to reload all of the entered values. This way you can create a similar block or add another field and delete the old block very FAST;
* Developers: field type "validate" function now returns true OR a string, where everything else but true will be an error string. Creating a block won't succeed and give a message with the returned string;
* Developers: field type "getSearchableContent" function added to be able to return some (unprocessed) PHP. See the "text_box" field type for usage;
* Developers: each field type function with $data array passed along, will now have each value directly in the array. Upon new field type creation, do not use these standard keys: row_id, slug, required, prefix, suffix, label, ft_count;
